# DJ Scratch

You're the DJ now.

This is a simple Twitter client that loads your current timeline. 

As you catch up on your friends' latest activities, the sound effects of scratched vinyl raise procrastination to an art form.

## Dependencies

Uses the Superpowered SDK to manipulate the audio clip. To build, you will need to have the Android NDK r10d or later installed, and provide a path to the NDK in `app/build.gradle`.

Uses the [CodePath OAuth client](https://github.com/codepath/android-oauth-handler) for Twitter integration.
